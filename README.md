# md5-hashing-collision
Small implementation of [md5](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/MD5/Implementation#Java) to check the collision of two X509 certificates, based on the work of [Stevens et al](https://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/TargetCollidingCertificates/).

This project is a part of a presentation for my "cryptography and it-security" class.
